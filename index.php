			<p class="text-justify">Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans and hence at such times, it is difficult for people to go and look for tests.  We as the students of VIT wants it easy for people to talk to doctors/book them and hence we came up with this web Application and also they can do a Self Assessment Test to stay at the safer side.
